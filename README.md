# FINX

### Milestone-Based Payments for Modern Businesses

FINX helps businesses manage project payments with confidence by connecting **milestones, deliverables, approvals, and payments** in one transparent workflow.

> **Build trust. Fund progress. Release with confidence.**

---

## 🚀 Why FINX?

B2B projects often fail because payment and delivery are disconnected.

Businesses face:

* Unclear project progress
* Delayed vendor payments
* Upfront payment risk
* Manual invoice and milestone tracking
* Poor visibility into fund movement
* Difficult dispute resolution

FINX brings all project stakeholders into one controlled payment workflow.

## 🔐 Security Principles

FINX is designed around secure financial workflows.

* Payment amounts are validated by the backend.
* Frontend payment status is never trusted.
* Razorpay signatures are verified server-side.
* Webhooks are validated before processing.
* Idempotency prevents duplicate payment actions.
* Release operations are protected against duplication.
* Role-based and resource-level authorization is enforced.
* Secrets are stored in environment variables.
* Sensitive information is excluded from logs.
* Audit logs are append-only.
* Database transactions protect financial state changes.
* Production traffic must use HTTPS.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Verification

### Automated End-to-End Suite (170 assertions across 28 phases)
To run the comprehensive live integration and security hardening test suite:
```bash
node test-e2e-workflow.mjs
```
This executes and verifies:
1. Google OAuth security & config sanitization
2. Registration, login, and JWT rotation
3. Cross-user IDOR protections (Buyer A vs B, Seller A vs B)
4. Deal creation, acceptance, and cancellation lifecycle
5. Milestone progress (Pending -> In Progress -> Under Review -> Approved)
6. Deliverable validation & size constraints (>4000 characters rejected)
7. Razorpay order creation and HMAC-SHA256 signature verification
8. Fiat escrow ledger double-entry funding and release
9. Double-release rejection (HTTP 400)
10. Legal disputes & arbitration (Freeze deal, admin ruling, resolution notes)
11. Complete append-only audit trail logging (15 distinct business events)
12. Zero floating-point monetary precision

### Backend Unit & Integration Tests (38/38 classes passing)
```bash
cd backend
./mvnw clean test
```

### Frontend Typecheck & Production Build
```bash
cd frontend
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run lint
npm run build
```
